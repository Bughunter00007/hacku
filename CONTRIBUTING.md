## Contributing to the source code

First of all, thanks for your interest in contributing to the DreamTime source code.

Like any open-source project we are always looking to accept contributions to improve the project code. To make this process as easy and fast as possible, please note the following:

- All contributions must be made in the `canary` branch.
- For now we are only accepting contributions that fix bugs, improve the current code or implement new features within the context of the program: An easy-to-use user interface to create fake nudes.
  - Changes to external modules such as telemetry will only be accepted if they fix security vulnerabilities.
- In case of adding a new dependency please make sure it is actively maintained (Last update less than a year ago) and is well documented.
- Provide as much information as possible of the changes made in the description of your PR.
